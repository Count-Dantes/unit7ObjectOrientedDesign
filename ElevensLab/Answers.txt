Elevens Lab Questions



Activity 5
	1.) The returned assertion error states that is false is false for an empty deck.
	my best guess of the error would be that the code was not updating the index when
	removing a card.
	2.) The returned assertion error states that a deck that is expected to have a 
	size of one returns zero as it's size. I would anticipate that the code was not
	incrementing the size with the addition of a card.
	3.) The returned error states that d1 & d2 returned the same sequence. I would	
	assume that the code was not shuffling the cards at startup
	4.) The returned error stated that the first card delt from a 1 card deck was
	returned null. I would assume that this is due to the card object not being initialized
	while the size was incremented
	
Activity 6
	1.) 5&6
	2.) Because the other cards eliminate eachother in pairs
	3.) No, it is pure luck. If there is more possible play, the order does not mater
	because you can only match a card with it's elevens pair

Activity 7
	1.) I would need a deck of cards, my hands, a discard pile, and the spaces to place the card
	2.) The start of the algorithm would be to shuffle the cards, and deal out the initial
	spaces. Next, it would check for any possible matches.If there is a group of threes
	remove that group then replace the spaces with new cards. If there is a group of 
	twos, remove them. Next check to see if there are cards left in the deck. If there are
	none print a win screen. If yes, fill the empty spaces with cards. Next repete
	the algorithem. If there are no possible combos, print a loose state.
