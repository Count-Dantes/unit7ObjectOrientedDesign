Activity 5
	1.) The returned assertion error states that is false is false for an empty deck.
	my best guess of the error would be that the code was not updating the index when
	removing a card.
	2.) The returned assertion error states that a deck that is expected to have a 
	size of one returns zero as it's size. I would anticipate that the code was not
	incrementing the size with the addition of a card.
	3.) The returned error states that d1 & d2 returned the same sequence. I would	
	assume that the code was not shuffling the cards at startup
	4.) The returned error stated that the first card delt from a 1 card deck was
	returned null. I would assume that this is due to the card object not being initialized
	while the size was incremented
